\ch{A}City dweller, \ch{E}successful fella

\ch{Bm}Thought to himself, 

"Oops, I've got a lot of mone\ch{A}y!"

                             
Caught in a \ch{D/C}rat race terminall\ch{A}y 


                                E
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
    Bm                                               D
I'm paying the price of living life at the legal limit (to the limit)
              D/C              A 
Caught in the century's anxiety 
       E
Yes it preys on him (preys on him)
He's getting thin (getting thin) {tricycle life}
\end{songverse}

 A                                            E7       E - Eb      
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country 
         D                                             A
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
             A                                                 E7      E - Eb
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
                 D                                       A 
Oh, it's like an animal farm, lots of rural charm in the country 

\end{songchorus}
 
 \begin{songverse}
                          
He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Bm 
Everything's going jackanorry
D                 D/C          A
Touched with his own mortality
     A                  E 
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
       Bm                                           D
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
             D/C            A  
Oh, it's the century's remedy
        E 
For the faint at heart
  E 
A new start (new start) {tricycle life}

 \end{songverse}
 
\begin{songchorus}                                 

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country 
           D                                                  A
He's got a fog in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country
           A                                              E7       E - Eb 
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths in the country 
                   D                                  A
But you'll come to no harm on the animal farm in the country 
E
In the country (Doo doo doo)
E 
In the country (Doo doo doo)
E 
In the country-y-y!
