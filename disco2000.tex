		Well we were \ch{F}{born} within an hour of each other

		Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
              
		Your name is \ch{Bb}{Deborah}.  Deborah, it never suited you
         
		And they \ch{F}{said} that when we grew up 

		We'd get married and never split up
           
		We never \ch{Bb}{did}, although I often thought of it		 
	 \end{SongVerse}

	 \begin{SongVerse}	     
	                  
		Oh Deborah, do you \ch{Cm}{recall}?

		Your house was very small

		With wood chip on the wall
                         
		And when I came round to \ch{Cm}{call}

		You didn't notice me at all 		
	 \end{SongVerse}

	 \begin{SongVerse}
                          
		And I said, \ch{Bb}{lets} all meet up in the year 2000
                                        
		\ch{Dm}{Won't} it be strange when we're all fully \ch{Gm}{grown}
                                          
		Be there 2 o'clock by the \ch{Cm}{fountain} down the \ch{F}{road}

		\ch{Bb}{I} never knew that you'd get married 
                             
		\ch{Dm}{I} would be living down here on my \ch{Gm}{own}   

		On that damp and lonely \ch{Cm}{thursday} years \ch{F}{ago} 
	\end{SongVerse}

	\begin{SongVerse}
		
		You were the first girl at school to get breasts.
		
		Martyn said that yours were the best.
		
		The boys all loved you but I was a mess.
		
		I had to watch them trying to get you undressed.
		
		We were friends but that was as far as it went.
		
		I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant,
		oh it meant nothing to you,
		cos you were so popular.
