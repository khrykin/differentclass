\begin{songverse}
\ch{G}Stone love, she kneels before the grave

A \ch{Em}brave son, who gave his life to 

see the slo\ch{C}gan,

That hovers between the headstone

and her \ch{G}eyes\quad\ch{Bm}

For they pene\ch{Am}trate her grieving.\ch{D}

\end{songverse}
\begin{songverse}

\ch{G}New love, a boy and girl they talking

\ch{Em}New words, that only they can share in

\ch{C}New words, a love so strong it

tears their hearts to \ch{G}sleep\ch{Bm},

Through the fleeting \ch{Am}hours of 

morning\ch{D}

\end{songverse}
\begin{songchorus}

\ch{Am}Love is careless in its choosing,

\ch{Em}Sweeping over cross a baby.

\ch{F}Love descends on \ch{C}those defenseless,

\ch{D}Idiot love will spark the fusion.


\ch{C}Inspirations \ch{D}have I none,

Just to \ch{G\up{7}}touch the flaming \ch{C}dove.

\ch{Cm}All I have is my \ch{G}love of love

And \ch{D}love is not loving.

\end{songchorus}

\begin{songverse}


\ch{G}Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and

\ch{Em}Told of love, and how my God on high is

\ch{C}All love, though reaching up my 

loneliness ev\ch{G}olves\quad\ch{Bm}

By the blindness th\ch{Am}at surrounds

 him \ch{D}.
