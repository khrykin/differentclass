\begin{songverse}


\ch{Riff 1}\hspace{30pt}\ch{C}When you raise your pencil \ch{A}skirt like a 

\ch{D}veil before my \ch{G}eyes \ch{Riff 2}

 \ch{C}Like the look upon his \ch{A}face as he's

 
 \ch{D}zipping up his \ch{G}flies, \ch{Riff 2}oh


 \ch{C}But I \ch{A}know that


 \ch{D}you're engaged to \ch{G}him  \ch{Riff 2}, oh


\ch{C}\hspace{10pt}But I  \ch{A}know you \ch{D}want something 


to \ch{G}play with, baby

\begin{songchorus}

 \ch{Em}I'll be around when he's not in 
 
 town, oh \ch{C}


 Yeah I'll show you how you're 
 
 doing it wrong, oh \ch{Em}


 I really love it when you tell me 
 
 to stop, oh oh \ch{D}
                
 
 Oh it's turning me \ch{G}on

\ch{C}But I've kissed your mother \ch{A}twice and


I'm work\ch{D}ing on your \ch{G}dad, oh baby


\end{songverse}

\begin{songchorus}

 to stop, oh oh \ch{D}
                
 
 Oh it's turning me \ch{G}on

\end{songchorus}


\begin{songverse}
\ch{Riff 2}\hspace{30pt} \ch{C}If you look under the \ch{A}bed then I can \ch{D}see my house 

from \ch{G}here \ch{Riff 2}

 \ch{C}So just lie against  the \ch{A}wall and watch my  \ch{D}conscience disap\ch{G}pear, now baby oh


 \ch{Em}Yeah, I'll be around when he's not in town, oh

 Oh don't you \ch{Em}know it's ugly and it shouldn't be like that.
