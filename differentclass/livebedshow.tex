\begin{songverse*}[Intro]
	She d\ch{Am}{o}esn't have to go to work
	
	But she d\ch{Am}{o}esn't want to stay in bed
	
	Cause it's cha\ch{Em}{n}ged from something comfortable\ch{E}{}
	
	To something else inst\ch{Am}{e}ad
\end{songverse*}

\begin{songverse}

	This b\ch{Am}{e}d has seen it all 
	
	From the f\ch{Em}{i}rst time to the last
	
	The sil\ch{G}{e}nces of now and the 
	
	Go\ch{Dmaj\up7}{o}d times of the past
	
	And it on\ch{D7}{l}y cost ten pounds 
	
	From the s\ch{G}{h}op just down the road
	
	Mind you, that was se\ch{Fmaj\up7}{v}en years ago 
	
	An\ch{E}{d} things were very differe\ch{Am}{n}t then

\end{songverse}


\begin{songverse}

	It \ch{Am}{d}idn't get much rest at first 
	
	The \ch{Em}{h}eadboard banging in the night
	
	The \ch{G}{n}eighbours didn't dare complain, 
	
	Oh \ch{Dmaj\up7}{e}verything was going right
	
	Now there's \ch{D7}{n}o need to complain 
	
	Cause it \ch{G}{n}ever makes a sound
	
	Something \ch{Fmaj\up7}{b}eautiful left town 
	
	And she \ch{E}{d}oesn't even know it's \ch{Am}{n}ame
 \end{songverse}


 \begin{songchorus}     
	\ch{F}\hspace{20pt} Now every night she plays a si\ch{D}{l}ent game 
		
	\ch{F}\hspace{20pt} Called pretending nothing's going wr\ch{D}{o}ng
	
	
	But she kn\ch{G}{o}ws if this s\ch{Fmaj7}{h}ow was televised
	
	
	No one would w\ch{E}{a}tch it, 
	
	Not tonight, but seven years a\ch{Am}{g}o...
