		\ch{A}Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits. 

		\ch{E}Raised on a diet of broken biscuits, oh \ch{F\#m}

		We don't look the same as you \ch{D}
		
		We don't do the things you do,
		
		But \ch{D7}we live around here too, oh really.

	 \begin{songverse}
		\ch{A}Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits,

		We'd \ch{E}like to go to town but we can't risk it, oh \ch{F\#m} 

		'Cos they just want to keep us out. \ch{D}
		
		You could end up with a smack in the mouth

		\ch{D7}Just for standing out, now really.
	 \end{songverse}

	 \begin{songverse}

		\ch{A}Brothers, sisters, can't you \ch{E}see? 

		The future's owned by you and \ch{F\#m}me. 

		There won't be fighting in the \ch{D}street. 

		They think they've got us beat, 

		But \ch{D\up7}revenge is going to be so sweet.

		\ch{A} Check your lucky numbers.

		\ch{E}That much money could drag you under, oh. \ch{F\#m}

		What's the point of being rich \ch{D}

		if you can't think what to do 
		
		with it 

		'cos \ch{D\up7}you're so bleeding thick?
