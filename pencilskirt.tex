\begin{SongVerse}

 \ch{C}When you raise your pencil \ch{A}skirt 


 like a \ch{D}veil before my \ch{G}eyes

 
 \ch{C}Like the look upon his \ch{A}face as he's

 
 \ch{D}zipping up his \ch{G}flies, oh


 \ch{C}But I \ch{A}know that


 \ch{D}you're engaged to \ch{G}him, oh \ch{C}


But I  \ch{A} know you \ch{D}want something 


to \ch{G}play with, baby

\end{SongVerse}

\begin{SongVerse}

 \ch{Em}I'll be around when he's not in town, oh \ch{C}


 Yeah I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh \ch{Em}


 I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh oh \ch{D}
                
 
 Oh it's turning me \ch{G}on

\end{SongVerse}

\begin{SongVerse}

\ch{C} Now you can tell some \ch{A}lies about the


\ch{D}good times that you've \ch{G}had


\ch{C}But I've kissed your mother \ch{A}twice and


I'm work\ch{D}ing on your \ch{G}dad, oh baby


\end{SongVerse}

\begin{SongVerse}

 \ch{Em}I'll be around when he's not in town, oh \ch{C}


 Yeah I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh \ch{Em}


 I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh oh \ch{D}
                
 
 Oh it's turning me \ch{G}on

\end{SongVerse}
